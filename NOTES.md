# SETTING UP ES6: NOTES FROM READING THE BOOK #

### October 6th 2017 ###
- Reading what Babel is, why it's important to ES6, how to set it up.
- Babel is a "next gen" compiler for JS.
- It is also known as a transpiler (source-to-source compiler), which means I and others can use ES6, but it will "transpile" to ES5 so the code can be used in older browsers that don't fully support ES6 yet.
- Babel has its own CLI to easily compile files.
- You compile the files with `$ babel filename.js`
